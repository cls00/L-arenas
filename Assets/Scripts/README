RunSim is attached to the scene as a whole, and controls spawning of each generation, manages connections between agents, and writes data.

The following scripts are attached to each agent:
Genome - contains the gene sequence
Lifecycle - controls birth, death, and reproduction of the agent
AgentMotion - controls agent motion, including setting targets to move towards
CollectFood - manages collection, digestion, and sharing of food
