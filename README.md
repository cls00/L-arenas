This repository contains the source code for the paper:

**Resource availability and the evolution of cooperation in a 3D agent-based simulation.**

Submitted to The Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference ([GECCO2021](https://gecco-2021.sigevo.org/HomePage)) by *Lara Dal Molin, Jasmeen Kanwal, and Christopher Stone*.

### Running 

The project can be loaded using Unity 2020.1.17f1. A bulk experiment setup is inside the GECCO_ExperimentManag scene.

### Controls


The world can be navigated freely during simulation using **WASD** and mouse

Connections between agents can be visualised using **V** 

Different colour schemes can be applied with **C**:
  - Cyan/Magenta for High and Low sharing phenotypes
  - Red/ Green for received or shared energy
  - Black/ White for sharer types preferential/random

The simulation speed can be increased with **F** descreased with **R** or set back to normal speed with **N**
